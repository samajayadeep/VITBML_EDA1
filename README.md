CONCLUSION: DATA ANALYSIS USING LIBRARIES SUCH AS NUMPY,PANDAS ALONG WITH DATA VISUALIZATION SUCH AS MATPLOTLIB AND SEABORN WERE IMPLEMENTED.

##The variables in the Dataset are as follows:

shipe mode:it describes about delivery class.

**sales**:it describes about the sales of the commodity

**quantity**:it tells about the quantity of items

**discount**:it tells about the discount offered on the purchase.
